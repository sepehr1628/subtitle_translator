# ðŸ¤” WHY I wrote this?
Actually, my friend is learning Rhino to create 3D models, and the course she's taking is in English. Since she's not very good at English, I decided to write a script to translate the English subtitles into Persian so she can keep moving forward.
I'm happy to help people learn and grow. :)

# ðŸš€ How to use?
Clone the project :

```
git clone https://github.com/sepehr1628/subtitle_translator
```
Go to project directory :
```
cd subtitle_translator
```

Install dependencies :
```
npm install
```

Now by turn put your srt files one by one in ** EnglishVersionSubtitles ** directory and run :
```	
node index.js
```	
Wait while the process to complete and your translated subtitle has cooked.
