**This project can't be done!**

# ‚ÅâÔ∏è why
Most of libraries do translations, need to purchase or have API Key that is no possible for Persians.
Signing up is usual but to verify your self it needs a credit card that is not supported in my country. Soo I'm willing to someone do this favor and introduce a way to new library to finish this project and be my contributor :)

### üåü BTW Let's Talk About Project
On the box in the middle of page you can drop your file or click and choose it. It suppossed to display a button for download the translated subtitle and the proccess is done and translated content is ready.
**warning: Only .srt files are allowed.**

# üí• The Script Translator
Because of the project I've added a script in the script folder that translates .srt files from English to Persian. 

### How The Script Works?
Get the project locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/sepehr1628/subtitle_translator
```

Go to the right path:
```
cd translator_script
```

Put your .srt file that you need to translate in the **EnglishVersionSubtitles**.
Now run the script to start the proccess:
```
node index.js
```

Now your translated subtitle is cooked. Actually it suppossed to be cooked.

# ü§î Why Script Works But Not The Page?
There is two kind of libraries support translation:

1.Those run in nodejs environment so they don't need any additional tool to translate and work fine.

2.Those work in client side and needs api key to work
